# Route Planning Project

This is my resolution for the Udacity C++ NanoDegree first project.
It's a guided project to test my knowledge about OOP

I runned it locally and I’m using OpenSuse Leap 15.5, so it was a bit tricky.
I had to build and install the IO2D library, some dependencies weren’t on the official documentation and some CMake files weren't working right, so I had to correct some variables.

In the end, I learned a lot about CMake and got a cemented knowledge of OOP.
